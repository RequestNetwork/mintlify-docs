## Overview

Request Network supports payments on NEAR Protocol, a sharded, proof-of-stake blockchain that offers unique capabilities compared to EVM-compatible chains. NEAR's architecture enables more complex smart contract interactions through asynchronous callbacks and cross-contract calls.

<Note>
NEAR support is currently available through the **Request Network SDK only**. The Request Network API does not support NEAR blockchain interactions.
</Note>

## Key Differences from EVM Chains

NEAR Protocol has several important architectural differences that affect how payments work:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Asynchronous Callbacks" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Unlike EVM chains where transactions are atomic, NEAR supports **asynchronous callbacks** that can span multiple transactions or blocks. This enables more complex payment flows but requires different handling.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Account-Based System" icon="user">
    NEAR uses human-readable account names (like `alice.near`) instead of hex addresses. Smart contracts are deployed to named accounts and can be upgraded by their owners.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Storage Deposits" icon="database">
    To receive NEP-141 fungible tokens, accounts must first register with the token contract and pay a small storage deposit (~0.00125 NEAR) to cover storage costs.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Gas Model" icon="gas-pump">
    NEAR uses a different gas model with TGas (TeraGas) units. Payment transactions typically require 50-400 TGas depending on complexity.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Supported Payment Types

### Native NEAR Payments

Direct payments using NEAR's native token through the payment proxy smart contract.

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Direct NEAR token transfers with payment references
- ‚úÖ Fee collection support
- ‚úÖ Payment detection and indexing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Contract is locked (non-upgradable) per NEAR Foundation requirements

### Fungible Token Payments (NEP-141)

Payments using NEAR's fungible token standard (NEP-141) equivalent to ERC-20 on Ethereum.

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Support for all NEP-141 compliant tokens
- ‚úÖ Fee collection in the same token
- ‚úÖ Upgradable proxy contract
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires storage deposit registration

### Native Token Conversion Payments

Convert from fiat currencies or other tokens to NEAR native tokens during payment.

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Fiat-to-NEAR conversion payments
- ‚úÖ Oracle-based price feeds
- ‚úÖ Maximum slippage protection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher gas costs due to cross-contract calls

## Smart Contract Addresses

### Mainnet (near)

| Payment Type | Contract Address | Status | Description |
|--------------|------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Native NEAR Payments** | `requestnetwork.near` | üîí Locked | Direct NEAR token payments with references |
| **Fungible Token Payments** | `pay.reqnetwork.near` | üîÑ Upgradable | NEP-141 token payments with fees |
| **Native Conversion Payments** | `native.conversion.reqnetwork.near` | üîÑ Upgradable | Fiat/token to NEAR conversions |

### Testnet (near-testnet)

| Payment Type | Contract Address | Status | Description |
|--------------|------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Fungible Token Payments** | `pay.reqnetwork.testnet` | üîÑ Upgradable | NEP-141 token payments with fees |
| **Native Conversion Payments** | `native.conversion.reqnetwork.testnet` | üîÑ Upgradable | Fiat/token to NEAR conversions |

<Info>
**Contract Ownership**: Upgradable contracts are owned by `reqnetwork.near` with private keys secured in the team's credential management system.
</Info>

## Technical Considerations

### Asynchronous Callbacks

NEAR's asynchronous architecture means payment transactions may require multiple blockchain interactions:

```javascript
// Example: Fungible token payment flow
1. Call ft_transfer_call on token contract
2. Token contract calls proxy contract 
3. Proxy processes payment and logs event
4. Callback confirms or reverts transaction
```

This differs from EVM chains where the entire payment happens in a single atomic transaction.

### Storage Deposits

Before receiving NEP-141 tokens, accounts must register with the token contract:

<Warning>
**Important**: Payment addresses must have sufficient storage deposit registered with the token contract. The SDK automatically checks for this requirement and will throw an error if the recipient is not properly registered.
</Warning>

**Minimum Storage Deposit**: ~0.00125 NEAR per token contract

### Gas Considerations

NEAR payment transactions have different gas requirements:

| Payment Type | Typical Gas Cost | Description |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Native NEAR** | 50 TGas | Simple transfer with reference |
| **Fungible Token** | 200 TGas | Cross-contract call to token |
| **Conversion Payment** | 300-400 TGas | Multiple contract interactions |

<Tip>
Gas costs are predictable and much lower than Ethereum mainnet, typically costing fractions of a cent in USD terms.
</Tip>

## Integration Guide

### Prerequisites

1. **NEAR Wallet Connection**: Applications need to integrate with NEAR wallet providers
2. **SDK Installation**: Use `@requestnetwork/request-client.js` with NEAR support
3. **Account Registration**: Ensure payment recipients are registered for token contracts

### Basic Payment Flow

```javascript
import { RequestNetwork } from '@requestnetwork/request-client.js';

// Create request for NEAR native payment
const request = await requestNetwork.createRequest({
  currency: {
    type: 'ETH', // NEAR native uses ETH type
    value: 'NEAR',
    network: 'near'
  },
  expectedAmount: '1000000000000000000000000', // 1 NEAR in yoctoNEAR
  paymentAddress: 'recipient.near'
});
```

<Note>
For complete integration examples and SDK usage, see the [Request Network SDK Documentation](/sdk-legacy/migration-guide).

## Network Information

| Network | Chain ID | Native Currency | Explorer |
|---------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **NEAR Mainnet** | N/A | NEAR | [nearblocks.io](https://nearblocks.io) |
| **NEAR Testnet** | N/A | NEAR | [testnet.nearblocks.io](https://testnet.nearblocks.io) |

## Limitations

<Warning>
**Current Limitations:**
- NEAR support is SDK-only (not available in Request Network API)
- Li.Fi bridge integrations do not support NEAR
- Some advanced features like batch payments are not yet implemented
- Cross-chain payments to/from NEAR require manual coordination
</Warning>
