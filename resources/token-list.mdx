const tokenList = await fetch(
  "https://requestnetwork.github.io/request-token-list/latest.json"
).then((res) => res.json());
```

## Token List Structure

Each token in the list contains the following information:

```json
{
  "id": "USDC-mainnet",
  "name": "USD Coin",
  "symbol": "USDC",
  "decimals": 6,
  "address": "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
