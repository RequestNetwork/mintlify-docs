## Overview

Request Network supports two primary payment workflows and multiple payment types to accommodate different business needs.

## Payment Workflows

### Invoice-first Workflow
Create a payment request first, then allow customers to pay at their convenience.

**Use Cases:** Professional invoicing, B2B payments, formal payment collection

### Payment-first Workflow  
Send payments directly without creating a request first.

**Use Cases:** Vendor payments, contractor payouts, immediate transfers

## Direct Payment Types

**Direct Payments** include Native, ERC20, and Conversion payments - the foundational payment methods that other features build upon.
