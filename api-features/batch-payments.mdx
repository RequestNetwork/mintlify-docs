## Overview

Batch payments allow you to process multiple direct or conversion payments in a single blockchain transaction, significantly reducing gas costs and simplifying payment operations.

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Multiple Recipients] --> B[Single Transaction]
    B --> C[Atomic Execution]
    C --> D[All Succeed or All Fail]
```

**Benefits:**
- **Gas Savings:** Up to 60% reduction in total gas costs
- **Atomic Operations:** All payments succeed or fail together
- **Simplified Management:** One transaction to monitor

## Requirements

- All payments must be on the same network
- Supports Native, ERC20, and Conversion payments
- Maximum batch size limited by block gas limit
