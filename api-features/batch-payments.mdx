## Overview

Batch payments allow you to process multiple direct or conversion payments in a single blockchain transaction, significantly reducing gas costs and simplifying payment operations.

## How It Works

- **Atomic Operations:** All payments succeed or fail together
- **Simplified Management:** One transaction to monitor

## Requirements
