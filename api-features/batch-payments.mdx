## Overview

Batch payments allow you to process multiple direct or conversion payments in a single blockchain transaction, significantly reducing gas costs and simplifying payment operations.

## How It Works

    A[Multiple Recipients] --> B[Single Transaction]

    C --> D[All Succeed or All Fail]
```

**Benefits:**

- **Atomic Operations:** All payments succeed or fail together
- **Simplified Management:** One transaction to monitor

## Requirements

- Supports Native, ERC20, and Conversion payments
- Maximum batch size limited by block gas limit
