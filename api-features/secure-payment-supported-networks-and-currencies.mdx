## Coverage model

Secure Payment Pages use the same chain and currency coverage as standard Request API request flows.

This means supported options are the networks and currencies available through the API token list and request creation endpoints.

## Supported currencies

Currencies are determined by the Request token list and available per network.

Use `GET /v2/currencies` to query support by network.

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.request.network/v2/currencies?network=sepolia" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json Example
[
  {
    "id": "FAU-sepolia",
    "name": "FAU",
    "symbol": "FAU",
    "decimals": 18,
    "network": "sepolia",
    "type": "ERC20",
    "chainId": 11155111
  }
]
```
</ResponseExample>

## How to verify support

- Query `GET /v2/currencies` with `network` and `symbol` filters for discovery
- Validate currency IDs before calling `POST /v2/secure-payments`
- Use the same network and currency validation rules you apply to normal request flows

## Preflight checklist

- Confirm each currency ID exists in `GET /v2/currencies`
- Confirm each request network is supported by your target flow
- Confirm your selected currencies are available on those networks
