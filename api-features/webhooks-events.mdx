## Overview

Webhooks provide real-time notifications when payment and request events occur, enabling immediate response to status changes without constant polling.

## Event Categories

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Payment/Request Event] --> B[Webhook Triggered]
    B --> C[HMAC Signature]
    C --> D[HTTP POST to Your Endpoint]
    D --> E[Signature Verification]
    E --> F[Process Event]
    F --> G[Return 200 OK]
```

**Process:**
1. **Event occurs:** Payment confirmed, request created, compliance updated
2. **Secure delivery:** HMAC-signed POST to your configured endpoint
3. **Your processing:** Verify signature, update application state
4. **Reliable delivery:** Automatic retries with exponential backoff

## Development Setup

### Local Testing
- **Portal testing:** Send test webhooks from Request Portal
- **ngrok integration:** Receive webhooks locally during development
- **Signature verification:** Always validate `x-request-network-signature` header

### Security Requirements
- **HTTPS endpoints only** for production webhook URLs
- **SHA-256 HMAC verification** using your webhook signing secret
- **Return 2xx status code** for successful processing (200, 201, etc.)
