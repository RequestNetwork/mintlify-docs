## Overview

Custom fees enable service providers to add their own fees to payment requests, supporting business models that require fee collection from transactions.

    A[Base Amount: $100] --> B[+ Service Fee: $5]
    B --> C[+ Network Fee: 0.5%]
    C --> D[Total: $105.50]
```

- **Split:** Separate fee recipient addresses
- **Transparent:** Clear fee breakdown for payers

## Fee Configuration

### Service Provider Fees
