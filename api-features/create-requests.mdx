## Overview

Request creation forms the foundation of Request Network operations, enabling structured payment collection through invoice generation and payment request workflows.

<Tip>
**Start building:** Creating requests is a key step for any payment workflow. See complete examples with invoice metadata and custom branding in our [Invoicing use case](/use-cases/invoicing).
