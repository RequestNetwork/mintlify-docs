## Overview

Partial payments allow requests to be fulfilled through multiple transactions, enabling split payments, installment plans, and flexible funding approaches.

<Tip>
**Flexible invoice payments:** Enable customers to pay invoices in installments or from multiple wallets. Combine with [conversion payments](/api-features/conversion-payments) for fiat-denominated installment plans. See examples in our [Invoicing use case](/use-cases/invoicing).
</Tip>

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request: $1000] --> B[Payment 1: $400]
    A --> C[Payment 2: $300] 
    A --> D[Payment 3: $300]
    B --> E[Request Fulfilled]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```

**Benefits:**
- **Flexible Payment Plans:** Installments and split payments
- **Multiple Funding Sources:** Different wallets, chains, or currencies
- **Risk Management:** Partial fulfillment tracking
