## Overview

Crosschain payments enable seamless transactions across different blockchain networks, allowing payers to send from their preferred chain while payees receive on their preferred network.

## How It Works

```mermaid

    A[Payer: USDC on Polygon] --> B[Bridge Protocol]
    B --> C[Payee: USDC on Base]
```

**Benefits:**
- Access to funds across multiple chains
- Automatic routing optimization  
- No manual bridging required

## Samechain Payments

A special case of crosschain infrastructure that converts currencies on the same network (e.g., ETH â†’ USDC on Ethereum).

## Supported Networks
