## Request Network SDK

The Request Network SDK provides direct access to the Request Network protocol for advanced use cases and custom integrations.

<Note>
**Most developers should use the [Request Network API](/api-setup/getting-started)** instead of the SDK. The API provides a simpler interface with built-in features like webhooks, payment processing, and managed infrastructure.
</Note>

## When to Use the SDK

The SDK is recommended for:

- **NEAR blockchain integration** - NEAR support is currently SDK-only
- **Custom protocol interactions** - Direct access to Request Network's core protocol
- **Advanced cryptographic operations** - Custom encryption and signing workflows
- **Protocol-level development** - Building on top of Request Network infrastructure

## API vs SDK Comparison

| Feature | API (Recommended) | SDK |
|---------|-------------------|-----|
| **Setup Complexity** | Simple - API key authentication | Complex - Direct protocol integration |
| **Webhooks** | ✅ Built-in | ❌ Manual implementation required |
| **Payment Processing** | ✅ Automated | 🔧 Manual transaction handling |
| **Supported Chains** | EVM chains (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) | EVM chains + NEAR |
| **Maintenance** | Request Network handles infrastructure | You manage all infrastructure |
| **Best For** | Most applications | NEAR support, protocol development |
