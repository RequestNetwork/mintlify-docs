## Overview

Traditional crypto payments lack business context. You receive a <Tooltip tip="Unique identifier of a transaction recorded on the blockchain">transaction hash,</Tooltip> but don't know which customer, invoice, or order it's for. Manual reconciliation is error-prone and doesn't scale.

Request IDs solve this by attaching business context to every payment. Each request gets a unique Request ID that connects payments back to your specific invoice, order, or subscription with cryptographic certainty.

**What you get:**
- **Automatic attribution** - Every payment linked to its request via Request ID
- **Multi-chain monitoring** - Track payments across 9 EVM chains in 150+ currencies
- **Real-time notifications** - <Tooltip tip="HTTP callbacks that notify your server when payment events occur">Webhooks</Tooltip> for instant payment confirmations
- **Zero manual work** - No spreadsheets, no guessing, no payment collisions

## When to Use Payment Detection

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Payment Collisions" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Multiple payments of the same amount create attribution problems - you can't tell which customer paid
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="High Payment Volume" icon="chart-line">
    Processing hundreds or thousands of crypto payments where manual tracking doesn't scale
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Wallet Management Overhead" icon="key">
    Managing separate wallets for each customer or transaction creates operational complexity
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Cross-chain Payments" icon="link">
    Accepting payments across multiple blockchains and need unified detection without managing multiple APIs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Scenarios

### E-commerce Checkout
Accept crypto payments at scale without generating unique addresses for each customer.

**Example:** An e-commerce platform processes 10,000+ crypto orders per day. Each order gets a unique Request ID - customers pay to a single wallet address, and every payment is automatically attributed to the correct order.

### SaaS Subscriptions
Add crypto as a payment option for recurring billing alongside traditional payment methods.

**Example:** A SaaS company uses Stripe for card payments but offers USDC for monthly subscriptions. Payment Detection automatically confirms renewals and updates subscription status without manual tracking.

### Manual Invoices with Crypto Settlement
Send invoices through existing channels (email, PDF) and accept crypto payments with automatic reconciliation.

**Example:** A freelancer emails invoices as PDFs with a Request ID. When clients pay in crypto, the accounting software automatically marks invoices as paid via <Tooltip tip="HTTP callbacks that notify your server when payment events occur">webhook</Tooltip> - no manual checking required.

These scenarios all use automatic payment detection. [See technical details on detection methods and configuration →](/api-features/payment-detection)

## How Payment Detection Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Request">
    When you create a request, it gets a unique Request ID for tracking
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customer Pays">
    Customer sends payment to your wallet address - the Request ID is connected to the transaction
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Detection">
    Request Network monitors <Tooltip tip="Decentralized networks where cryptocurrency transactions are recorded">blockchains</Tooltip> and matches payments to your requests
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get Notified">
    When a payment is detected, you receive a <Tooltip tip="HTTP callback that notifies your server when payment events occur">webhook</Tooltip> notification with payment details
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Payment Detection powers all Request Network use cases: [invoicing](/use-cases/invoicing), [payouts](/use-cases/payouts), [payroll](/use-cases/payroll), [checkout](/use-cases/checkout), and [subscriptions](/use-cases/subscriptions).
