## Overview

Payment Detection monitors blockchain networks to automatically identify and verify when payments are completed. Add crypto payment acceptance to your existing systems without rebuilding your entire infrastructure.

## When to Use Payment Detection

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Existing Business Logic" icon="building">
    You already have invoicing, billing, or business systems and just need crypto payment acceptance
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Single Wallet, Many Payments" icon="wallet">
    Collect payments at scale to one wallet address and automatically attribute each payment
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Real-time Verification" icon="clock">
    Need instant payment confirmation without manual blockchain checking
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Multi-chain Support" icon="link">
    Accept payments across Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, and 10+ EVM chains
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Scenarios

### Donations with Attribution
Accept crypto donations to a single wallet and automatically attribute each to the correct donor, campaign, or cause.

**Example:** A nonprofit collects donations from hundreds of donors to one Ethereum address. Each donation includes a Request ID, enabling automatic attribution and thank-you emails.

### SaaS Adding Crypto Payments
Existing subscription or billing platform adds crypto as a payment option alongside credit cards.

**Example:** A SaaS company uses Stripe for card payments but wants to offer USDC payments. Payment Detection monitors for crypto payments and updates subscription status automatically.

### Manual Invoices + Crypto Detection
Send invoices through existing channels (email, PDF) and let customers pay in crypto with automatic detection.

**Example:** A freelancer emails invoices as PDFs with a Request ID. Clients pay in crypto, and the freelancer's accounting software automatically marks invoices as paid via webhook.

### High-Volume Payment Collection
Collect thousands of payments without creating new wallet addresses for each transaction.

**Example:** An e-commerce platform processes 10,000+ crypto orders per day. Instead of generating unique addresses, each order gets a Request ID for attribution.

## How Payment Detection Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Payment Initiated">
    Customer sends crypto payment including the Request ID in the transaction reference
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Blockchain Monitoring">
    Request Network continuously scans supported blockchains for transactions matching your requests
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Payment Detected">
    When a matching payment is found, Request Network verifies amount, currency, and confirmations
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Webhook Notification">
    Your system receives a real-time webhook with payment details and status
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Reconciliation">
    Your business logic updates invoice status, triggers fulfillment, or sends receipts
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Detection Features

### Real-time Blockchain Scanning
- **Multi-chain monitoring:** Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, BSC, Gnosis, Fantom, Avalanche, and more
- **Sub-minute detection:** Typically detect payments within seconds of blockchain confirmation
- **Confirmation tracking:** Configurable confirmation thresholds for different security requirements

### Payment Verification
- **Amount matching:** Verify exact payment amount or accept partial payments
- **Currency validation:** Support for 553+ tokens across all supported chains
- **Smart contract verification:** Detect payments through ERC20, native tokens, and conversion proxies

### Webhook Integration
- **Event notifications:** `payment.detected`, `payment.confirmed`, `payment.failed`
- **Retry logic:** Automatic webhook retries with exponential backoff
- **Signature verification:** Cryptographically signed webhooks for security

## Detection-Only vs Full Workflows

Understanding when to use standalone payment detection versus integrated workflows:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Payment Detection Only">
    **Best for:** Existing systems that just need crypto payment acceptance
    
    **What you handle:**
    - Create invoices/requests in your existing system
    - Generate Request IDs via API
    - Include Request ID in payment instructions
    - Receive webhooks when payments are detected
    - Update your system based on payment status
    
    **What Request Network handles:**
    - Blockchain monitoring across all chains
    - Payment verification and confirmation tracking
    - Webhook delivery with retry logic
    - Permanent on-chain payment records
    
    **Example:** QuickBooks + crypto payments via Request Network detection
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Full Invoicing Workflow">
    **Best for:** Building new invoicing systems from scratch
    
    **What Request Network handles:**
    - Invoice creation with structured data
    - Payment link generation
    - Payment processing
    - Payment detection
    - Complete payment lifecycle management
    
    **What you handle:**
    - User interface and experience
    - Customer management
    - Business logic and workflows
    
    **Example:** [EasyInvoice](/use-cases/invoicing) - full-stack invoicing application
    
    [Learn more â†’](/use-cases/invoicing)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Other Use Cases">
    **Payment detection powers all Request Network use cases:**
    
    - **[Payouts](/use-cases/payouts):** Detection confirms batch payment completion
    - **[Payroll](/use-cases/payroll):** Detection verifies salary payments
    - **[Checkout](/use-cases/checkout):** Detection triggers order fulfillment
    - **[Subscriptions](/use-cases/subscriptions):** Detection handles recurring payments
    
    Each use case combines request creation with payment detection for specific workflows.

## Implementation Example

Here's a minimal example of using payment detection with webhooks:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js - Create Request
const response = await fetch('https://api.request.network/requests', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    currency: 'USDC-matic',
    expectedAmount: '100.00',
    paymentAddress: '0x...your-wallet',
    reason: 'Invoice #12345'
  })
});

const { requestId } = await response.json();
// Include requestId in payment instructions to customer
```

```javascript Node.js - Webhook Handler
app.post('/webhooks/request', (req, res) => {
  const { eventType, requestId, paymentAmount, status } = req.body;
  
  if (eventType === 'payment.detected') {
    // Payment detected on blockchain
    console.log(`Payment detected for ${requestId}: ${paymentAmount}`);
    
    // Update your system
    await updateInvoiceStatus(requestId, 'PAID');
    await sendReceiptEmail(requestId);
  }
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

```python Python - Webhook Handler
from flask import Flask, request

@app.route('/webhooks/request', methods=['POST'])
def handle_webhook():
    data = request.json
    
    if data['eventType'] == 'payment.detected':
        request_id = data['requestId']
        payment_amount = data['paymentAmount']
        
        # Update your system
        update_invoice_status(request_id, 'PAID')
        send_receipt_email(request_id)
    
    return '', 200
```
</CodeGroup>
