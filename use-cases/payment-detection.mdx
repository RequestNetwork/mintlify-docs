## Overview

Traditional crypto payments lack business context. You receive a <Tooltip tip="Unique identifier of a transaction recorded on the blockchain">transaction hash</Tooltip>, but don't know which customer, invoice, or order it's for. Manual reconciliation is error-prone and doesn't scale.

Request IDs solve this by attaching business context directly to payments. Every payment includes a unique Request ID, enabling automatic attribution and reconciliation with cryptographic certainty.

**What you get:**
- **Automatic attribution** - Every payment linked to its request (invoice, order, subscription)
- **Multi-chain monitoring** - Track payments across 9 EVM chains in 150+ currencies
- **Real-time notifications** - <Tooltip tip="HTTP callbacks that notify your server when payment events occur">Webhooks</Tooltip> for instant payment confirmations
- **Zero manual work** - No spreadsheets, no guessing, no payment collisions

## Common Scenarios

### Donations with Attribution
Accept crypto donations to a single wallet and automatically attribute each to the correct donor, campaign, or cause.

**Example:** A nonprofit collects donations from hundreds of donors to one Ethereum address. Each donation includes a Request ID, enabling automatic attribution and thank-you emails.

### SaaS Adding Crypto Payments
Add crypto as a payment option to existing subscription or billing platforms alongside credit cards.

**Example:** A SaaS company uses Stripe for card payments but wants to offer USDC payments. Payment Detection monitors for crypto payments and updates subscription status automatically.

### Manual Invoices with Crypto Settlement
Send invoices through existing channels (email, PDF) and let customers pay in crypto with automatic detection.

**Example:** A freelancer emails invoices as PDFs with a Request ID. Clients pay in crypto, and the freelancer's accounting software automatically marks invoices as paid via <Tooltip tip="HTTP callbacks that notify your server when payment events occur">webhook</Tooltip>.

### High-Volume Payment Collection
Collect thousands of payments without generating unique wallet addresses for each transaction.

**Example:** An e-commerce platform processes 10,000+ crypto orders per day. Instead of unique addresses, each order gets a Request ID for attribution.

## How Payment Detection Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Payment Initiated">
    Customer sends crypto payment including the Request ID in the transaction reference
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Blockchain Monitoring">
    Request Network continuously scans supported <Tooltip tip="Decentralized networks where cryptocurrency transactions are recorded">blockchains</Tooltip> for transactions matching your requests
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Payment Verified">
    When a matching payment is found, Request Network verifies amount, currency, and <Tooltip tip="The number of subsequent blocks added to the blockchain after your transaction, indicating finality">confirmations</Tooltip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Webhook Notification">
    Your system receives a real-time <Tooltip tip="HTTP callback that notifies your server when payment events occur">webhook</Tooltip> with payment details and status
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Reconciliation">
    Your business logic updates invoice status, triggers fulfillment, or sends receipts - no manual work needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Payment Detection powers all Request Network use cases: [invoicing](/use-cases/invoicing), [payouts](/use-cases/payouts), [payroll](/use-cases/payroll), [checkout](/use-cases/checkout), and [subscriptions](/use-cases/subscriptions). Every use case includes automatic detection with no manual tracking.
