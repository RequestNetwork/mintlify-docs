## Overview

Traditional crypto payments lack business context. You receive a <Tooltip tip="Unique identifier of a transaction recorded on the blockchain">transaction hash</Tooltip>, but don't know which customer, invoice, or order it's for. Manual reconciliation is error-prone and doesn't scale.

Request Network solves this with reference-based payment detection. Each request automatically generates a unique payment reference—a 16-character identifier included in the blockchain transaction. This connects every payment back to your specific invoice, order, or subscription with cryptographic certainty.

**What you get:**
- **Automatic attribution** - Every payment linked to its request via payment reference
- **Multi-chain monitoring** - Track payments across 9 EVM chains in 150+ currencies
- **Real-time notifications** - <Tooltip tip="HTTP callbacks that notify your server when payment events occur">Webhooks</Tooltip> for instant payment confirmations
- **Zero manual work** - No spreadsheets, no guessing, no payment collisions

## Common Scenarios

### Donations with Attribution
Accept crypto donations to a single wallet and automatically attribute each to the correct donor, campaign, or cause.

**Example:** A nonprofit collects donations from hundreds of donors to one Ethereum address. Each donation includes a unique payment reference, enabling automatic attribution and thank-you emails.

### SaaS Adding Crypto Payments
Add crypto as a payment option to existing subscription or billing platforms alongside credit cards.

**Example:** A SaaS company uses Stripe for card payments but wants to offer USDC payments. Payment Detection monitors for crypto payments and updates subscription status automatically.

### Manual Invoices with Crypto Settlement
Send invoices through existing channels (email, PDF) and let customers pay in crypto with automatic detection.

**Example:** A freelancer emails invoices as PDFs with a payment reference. Clients include the reference when paying in crypto, and the freelancer's accounting software automatically marks invoices as paid via <Tooltip tip="HTTP callbacks that notify your server when payment events occur">webhook</Tooltip>.

### High-Volume Payment Collection
Collect thousands of payments without generating unique wallet addresses for each transaction.

**Example:** An e-commerce platform processes 10,000+ crypto orders per day. Instead of unique addresses, each order gets a unique payment reference for attribution.

## How Payment Detection Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Payment Reference Generated">
    When you create a request, a unique 16-character payment reference is automatically generated
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customer Pays">
    Customer sends payment to your wallet address including the payment reference in the transaction
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Detection">
    Request Network monitors <Tooltip tip="Decentralized networks where cryptocurrency transactions are recorded">blockchains</Tooltip> for transactions containing your payment references
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get Notified">
    When a match is found, your request status updates and you receive a <Tooltip tip="HTTP callback that notifies your server when payment events occur">webhook</Tooltip> notification
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Payment Detection powers all Request Network use cases: [invoicing](/use-cases/invoicing), [payouts](/use-cases/payouts), [payroll](/use-cases/payroll), [checkout](/use-cases/checkout), and [subscriptions](/use-cases/subscriptions).
