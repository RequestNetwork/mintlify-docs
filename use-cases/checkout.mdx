## Overview

Accept crypto payments at the point of purchase with instant attribution and confirmation. Whether you're running an online store, selling digital goods, or processing event tickets, Request Network enables immediate crypto payments with automatic reconciliation at scale.

Unlike traditional crypto payments where customers send funds and you manually match transactions to orders, Request IDs automatically connect each payment to its specific order with cryptographic certainty.

**What you get:**
- **Instant attribution** - Every payment automatically linked to the correct order via Request ID
- **Multi-wallet support** - Accept payments from 80+ wallets via <Tooltip tip="Multi-wallet connection protocol enabling users to connect any supported wallet">WalletConnect</Tooltip>
- **Multi-currency flexibility** - Accept payments across 9 EVM chains in 150+ currencies
- **Real-time confirmations** - <Tooltip tip="HTTP callbacks that notify your server when payment events occur">Webhook</Tooltip> notifications for instant order fulfillment
- **High-volume ready** - Process thousands of orders per day without unique wallet addresses

## Common Scenarios

### Online Store Checkout
Accept crypto payments for physical or digital products without generating unique addresses for each customer.

**Example:** An online retailer processes 5,000+ orders per day. Customers add items to cart and pay in crypto at checkout. Each order gets a unique Request ID - all payments go to a single wallet address, and every transaction is automatically matched to the correct order for instant fulfillment.

### Digital Goods & Services
Sell software, subscriptions, or digital content with instant delivery upon payment confirmation.

**Example:** A SaaS platform offers monthly subscriptions payable in USDC. At checkout, customers connect their wallet and pay immediately. <Tooltip tip="HTTP callbacks that notify your server when payment events occur">Webhook</Tooltip> confirmation triggers instant account activation and service access.

### Event Ticketing
Process high-volume ticket sales with automatic ticket delivery and anti-fraud protection.

**Example:** A concert venue sells 10,000+ tickets. Each ticket purchase gets a unique Request ID. Upon payment confirmation, the system automatically generates and sends the ticket NFT or digital ticket to the customer's wallet.

### Multi-vendor Marketplace
Enable marketplace checkout where payments are automatically split between vendors and platform fees.

**Example:** An NFT marketplace processes sales from hundreds of creators. At checkout, buyer pays once - Request Network automatically splits payment between seller (90%), platform fee (8%), and creator royalty (2%) using a single transaction.

**Commerce escrow with fraud prevention** is in development for Base chain, enabling authorize-capture workflows with KYT (Know Your Transaction) checks. [Track progress →](https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork/issues/1650)
