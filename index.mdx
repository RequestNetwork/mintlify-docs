## What is a Payment Request?

Request Network transforms how businesses handle Web3 payments by creating transparent, traceable payment requests that both parties can trust. Unlike traditional payment methods where you send money and hope for the best, Request Network creates an immutable record that tracks the entire payment lifecycle.

**Key Benefits:**
- **100% Payment Reconciliation** - Never lose track of who paid what
- **Multi-Currency Support** - Invoice in USD, get paid in crypto across 10+ chains
- **Instant Settlement** - No waiting for bank transfers or payment processor holds
- **Programmable Logic** - Automate recurring payments, escrow, and complex payment flows
