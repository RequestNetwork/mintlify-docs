## **Core Functionality**

At its core, the Request Network API empowers you to:

- **Create Requests:** Define payment requests with information such as payee, payer (optional), amount, currency, and recurrence (optional).
- **Facilitate Payments:** Return transaction calldata, ready to be signed by end-users and sent to the blockchain for secure and transparent value transfer.
- **Deliver Webhook Notifications:** Receive instant updates on payment status changes, enabling your application to react dynamically to completed transactions.
- **Fee Collection:** When paying a request, you can specify a fee percentage (between 0 and 100) and a fee address, which will add the fee on top of the payment amount - meaning the payer will pay the original amount plus the fee percentage, with the fee portion being sent to the specified fee address.
- **Partial Payment Support:** Pay a portion of a request instead of the full amount at once. This unlocks powerful use cases such as:
	- **Split payment**: split a payment 50% USDC on Base and 50% with USDT on Optimism.
	- **Gradual payment plans:** Allow users to pay large invoices in smaller chunks.
	- **Risk mitigation:** Test with small amounts before completing large payments.
	The API automatically tracks payment progress, showing `partially_paid` status until the request is fully paid, and prevents overpayment by capping amounts to the remaining balance.
